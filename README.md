## SwiftRSA

SwiftRSA provides RSA cryptography in Swift. This encompasses:

* RSA key pair creation
* Loading existing keys from their PEM and DER encodings
* Encryption and decryption using either the PKCS1 scheme or the OAEP scheme
* Signature signing and verifying using either the PKCS1 scheme or the PSS scheme

SwiftRSA requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the `Int` and `UInt` types be 64 bit types.

Its documentation is build with the DocC plugin and published on GitHub Pages at this location:

https://leif-ibsen.github.io/SwiftRSA/documentation/swiftrsa

The documentation is also available in the *SwiftRSA.doccarchive* file.
